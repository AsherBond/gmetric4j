Name
    gmetric4j - gmetric and gmond functionality in Java

Version
    gmetric4j 1.0.0

    The latest version of this software and document will always be found at 
    http://github.com/ganglia/gmetric4j

Synopsis
    JMXetric is a 100% java, configurable Ganglia agent that periodically polls
    arbitrary attributes and reports their values to Ganglia.

    It supports both the v3.1 wire format and the legacy wire format.

    This code is based on the jmxetric project code.  It has been generalized for
    use in non-JMX environments (e.g. any Java app, Android app, ...)

    The gmetric protocol implementation uses classes generated by the LGPL 
    remotetea project (http://remotetea.sf.net).
